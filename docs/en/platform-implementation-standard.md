# Platform Implementation Standard

> This document defines the conventions and constraints that every SweetEditor platform implementation must follow.
> The goal is to keep cross-platform behavior consistent while allowing platform-specific rendering and input handling.
>
> This document describes the current repository code state (2026-03). If the document and source code are different, use the source code.
>
> Constraint levels:
> - **MUST** — all platforms must comply; violation is a bug.
> - **SHOULD** — recommended; deviation requires documented justification.
> - **MAY** — optional; platform decides based on its own needs.

---

## 1. Module Structure

Every platform implementation MUST include the following two logical layers and ensure all types within each category are implemented. File organization (directory structure, file granularity) MAY vary by language convention (e.g. Java uses package directories, C# uses one file per namespace, Swift uses Sources layering), but the logical categories MUST be identifiable and the types MUST be fully covered.

### 1.1 Core Layer (Pure Data / Models / Protocol)

The Core layer does not involve UI rendering. It contains only bridging, data models, and protocol encoding/decoding.

| Category | Required Types | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Bridge** | `EditorCore`, `Document`, `ProtocolEncoder`, `ProtocolDecoder`, `TextMeasurer`, `EditorOptions` | Native bridge + public core API wrapper |
| **Foundation** | `TextPosition`, `TextRange`, `IntRange`, `TextChange`, `WrapMode`, `FoldArrowMode`, `AutoIndentMode`, `CurrentLineRenderMode`, `ScrollBehavior` | Fundamental value types and enums |
| **Adornment** | `StyleSpan`, `SpanLayer`, `InlayHint`, `InlayType`, `PhantomText`, `CodeLensItem`, `LinkSpan`, `FoldRegion`, `GutterIcon`, `Diagnostic`, `IndentGuide`, `BracketGuide`, `FlowGuide`, `SeparatorGuide`, `SeparatorStyle`, `TextStyle` | Decoration data types |
| **Visual** | `EditorRenderModel`, `VisualLine`, `VisualLineKind`, `VisualRun`, `VisualRunType`, `PointerCursorType`, `Cursor`, `CursorRect`, `SelectionRect`, `SelectionHandle`, `ScrollMetrics`, `ScrollbarModel`, `ScrollbarRect`, `GuideSegment`, `GuideType`, `GuideDirection`, `GuideStyle`, `DiagnosticDecoration`, `CompositionDecoration`, `FoldMarkerRenderItem`, `FoldState`, `GutterIconRenderItem`, `LinkedEditingRect`, `BracketHighlightRect` | Render model types (geometry semantics follow Section 2.4) |
| **Snippet** | `LinkedEditingModel`, `TabStopGroup` | Linked editing / tab stop groups |
| **Keymap** | `KeyMap`, `KeyBinding`, `KeyChord`, `KeyCode`, `KeyModifier`, `EditorCommand` | Shortcut mapping data types and command identifiers |

### 1.2 Widget Layer (UI Controls / Rendering / Interaction)

The Widget layer handles platform-native rendering, user interaction, and extension systems.

| Category | Required Types | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Widget** | `SweetEditor`, `SweetEditorController` *(declarative frameworks MUST; imperative frameworks MAY)*, `EditorTheme`, `EditorSettings`, `EditorIconProvider`, `EditorMetadata`, `LanguageConfiguration` | Widget entry, controller, theme, configuration |
| **Decoration** | `DecorationProvider`, `DecorationProviderManager`, `DecorationContext`, `DecorationResult`, `DecorationType`; if the Receiver callback pattern is used, `DecorationReceiver` is the recommended name | Decoration provider system |
| **Completion** | `CompletionProvider`, `CompletionProviderManager`, `CompletionContext`, `CompletionItem`, `CompletionResult`; if the Receiver callback pattern is used, `CompletionReceiver` is the recommended name | Completion provider system |
| **Event** | A type-safe event mechanism, `EditorEvent`, `TextChangedEvent`, `CursorChangedEvent`, `SelectionChangedEvent`, `ScrollChangedEvent`, `ScaleChangedEvent`, `DocumentLoadedEvent`, `FoldToggleEvent`, `GutterIconClickEvent`, `InlayHintClickEvent`, `CodeLensClickEvent`, `LinkClickEvent`, `LongPressEvent`*(mobile only)*, `DoubleTapEvent`, `ContextMenuEvent`*(platforms with an explicit context-menu gesture entry point)*; if an explicit event-bus/listener pattern is used, `EditorEventBus` and `EditorEventListener` are the recommended names | Event system |
| **NewLine** | `NewLineActionProvider`, `NewLineActionProviderManager`, `NewLineAction`, `NewLineContext` | Newline action provider system |
| **Keymap** | `EditorKeyMap` | Widget-layer keymap extension that binds command ids to host-side handlers |
| **Copilot** *(SHOULD)* | `InlineSuggestion`, `InlineSuggestionListener` or an equivalent host-visible accept/dismiss callback mechanism; MAY: `InlineSuggestionController` | Inline suggestion data + callback; listener shape is the primary path when exposed |
| **Selection** *(SHOULD on mobile; desktop MAY omit)* | `SelectionMenuItem`, `SelectionMenuItemProvider`, a host-visible custom-item click callback mechanism; MAY: `SelectionMenuListener` | Selection menu (mobile SHOULD; desktop MAY omit) |
| **ContextMenu** *(MAY)* | `ContextMenuRequest`, `ContextMenuSection`, `ContextMenuItem`, `ContextMenuItemProvider`, `ContextMenuTriggerKind`, a host-visible custom-item click callback mechanism; MAY: `ContextMenuPopup` | Platform-side context menu / action menu (desktop SHOULD; mobile MAY) |
| **Perf** *(SHOULD)* | `PerfOverlay`, `MeasurePerfStats`, `PerfStepRecorder` | Performance overlay |

> `TextChangeAction` is a SHOULD-level auxiliary event enum. Platforms MAY expose it to classify a text-change cycle at a coarse level (for example: `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UNDO`, `REDO`, `KEY`, `COMPOSITION`), but it MUST NOT replace `changes: List<TextChange>` as the primary incremental payload.

### 1.3 Recommended Internal Implementation Patterns (SHOULD)

The following types are **internal implementation details**, not part of the public API contract. Platforms SHOULD adopt these patterns to organize internal logic, but MAY choose equivalent alternatives based on platform characteristics (e.g. implementing directly within the widget class, using platform-native Popup, etc.).

| Pattern | Recommended Types | Use Case | Benefits |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Renderer** | `EditorRenderer` | Separate rendering logic from the widget entry class | Single responsibility; rendering logic can be iterated and tested independently |
| **Controller** | `CompletionPopupController`, `InlineSuggestionController`, `SelectionMenuController`, `ContextMenuController` | Manage popup / overlay lifecycle and interaction logic | Decouples UI popups from data logic; platforms may implement directly with Popup instead |

> If adopting the above patterns, platforms SHOULD use the recommended names shown above. Section 2.1 governs only host-facing public type names, not these internal controller pattern names.
> Not adopting these patterns is not a violation, but equivalent functionality must be implemented elsewhere.

---

## 2. Naming Conventions

### 2.1 Class / Type Names (MUST)

All platforms MUST use the following canonical names for the principal public types listed below. Additional host-facing public types introduced in later sections MUST follow the same naming rules and use the canonical names defined where those types are introduced. Language-specific prefixes or suffixes are allowed only where mandated by the language convention (e.g. C# interface `I` prefix).

The widget entry class MUST use `SweetEditor` as prefix and MAY append the target platform's conventional UI component suffix:

| Suffix | Full Name | When to Use | Example Platforms |
|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | `SweetEditor` | Platform does not mandate a UI component suffix | Android View, Swing, OHOS ArkUI |
| `Control` | `SweetEditorControl` | Platform convention uses `Control` | WinForms, WPF |
| `Widget` | `SweetEditorWidget` | Platform convention uses `Widget` | Flutter, Qt |
| `View` | `SweetEditorView` | Platform convention uses `View` | SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit, React Native |
| `Component` | `SweetEditorComponent` | Platform convention uses `Component` | Web Components, React, Vue |
| `Element` | `SweetEditorElement` | Platform convention uses `Element` | Lit, Angular |

> Names without the `SweetEditor` prefix (e.g. `EditorControl`, `EditorView`, `EditorWidget`) are NOT allowed.
> If the target platform's conventional suffix is not listed above, a PR SHOULD be submitted to extend this table before implementation.

Other public types:

> **Naming variant rules:**
> - Languages whose convention requires an `I` prefix on interfaces (e.g. C#, TypeScript, Kotlin) MAY use the `I`-prefixed variant
> - Languages whose convention requires a project prefix on class names (e.g. Objective-C) MAY use the `SE` prefix variant (abbreviation of SweetEditor)
> - All other languages SHOULD use the canonical name directly

> If the event system uses platform-native `event` / delegate / stream / signal APIs, the platform does not need to expose public `EditorEventBus` / `EditorEventListener` types; in that case only the semantics in Section 11 are required.

### 2.2 Field / Property Names (MUST)

Data model fields MUST use the same semantic names across platforms, adapted to each language's casing convention:

| Java / ArkTS (camelCase) | C# (PascalCase) | Swift (camelCase) | Dart (camelCase) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `line` | `Line` | `line` | `line` |
| `column` | `Column` | `column` | `column` |
| `startColumn` | `StartColumn` | `startColumn` | `startColumn` |
| `endColumn` | `EndColumn` | `endColumn` | `endColumn` |
| `styleId` | `StyleId` | `styleId` | `styleId` |
| `scrollX` | `ScrollX` | `scrollX` | `scrollX` |
| `backgroundColor` | `BackgroundColor` | `backgroundColor` | `backgroundColor` |

### 2.3 Method Names (MUST)

Public API methods MUST follow each language's casing convention. Canonical names use Java/ArkTS camelCase as the baseline; each language adapts per its own convention (e.g. C# PascalCase, Go capitalized exports). See Section 3 for the full method list and allowed variants.

### 2.4 Host-Facing Public API Enum Types (MUST)

For host-facing public APIs (such as `SweetEditor`, `SweetEditorController`, `EditorSettings`, event payloads, and provider / context / result types consumed directly by host code), platforms MUST use enums or equivalent strong types for discrete value sets when the target language supports them.

- Host-facing public APIs MUST NOT prefer raw `int` values when the language already supports enums / strong typed constants
- If platform or framework constraints force a host-facing public API to expose integer constants, that layer MUST handle invalid values explicitly (see Section 15)
- Bitmask / flags fields MAY remain `int`-encoded in the public model when that representation is itself the intended cross-platform contract (for example `TextStyle.fontStyle`)
- Compact numeric semantic fields MAY remain `int`-encoded in the public model when this standard explicitly defines that numeric encoding as part of the contract (for example `Diagnostic.severity`)
- `EditorCore`, bridge layers, FFI layers, and other internal numeric transport layers are not considered host-facing public APIs for this rule

### 2.5 Geometry Carrier Types (MUST)

For simple geometry carriers used in public APIs and event payloads, platforms MAY use either the canonical SweetEditor geometry names or platform-native equivalents when the semantics are identical.

- Point types: `PointF` or a platform-native point type (e.g. Android `android.graphics.PointF`, Apple `CGPoint`)
- Rect types: `RectF` or a platform-native rect type (e.g. Android `android.graphics.RectF`, Apple `CGRect`)

If a platform-native geometry type is used, coordinate basis, axis direction, and field semantics MUST remain identical to the canonical SweetEditor model.

---

## 3. Public API Contract (MUST)

The following defines two distinct public API layers:
- Section 3.1 defines the `EditorCore` bridge/runtime API
- Section 3.2 defines the host-facing editor API

Platforms MUST implement every listed method on the appropriate API carrier. Section 3.1 methods belong to `EditorCore`; they are not implicitly part of the host-facing editor surface. In imperative frameworks the Section 3.2 carrier is the widget entry class itself (for example `SweetEditor`), while in declarative frameworks the Section 3.2 carrier is `SweetEditorController`. On declarative platforms, `SweetEditor` remains the runtime/session owner even though the host-facing API is exposed through the controller.

> Lifecycle / memory management APIs (e.g. `create`, `destroy`, `freeBinaryData`) are not listed here; each platform implements them per its own conventions.

**General naming variant rules:**
- Canonical names use Java/ArkTS camelCase as the baseline
- PascalCase languages (e.g. C#, Go): all method names use PascalCase (e.g. `setDocument` → `SetDocument`); this rule applies to all methods and is not repeated per row
- Each language MAY adapt parameter naming and calling style per its own conventions (e.g. Swift argument labels, Go export rules, Dart named parameters)
- The "Allowed Variants" column below only lists variants with **substantive differences** from the canonical name (e.g. getter as property, different method name semantics); `—` means no substantive difference

### 3.0 API Carrier Rules (MUST)

Editor components inherently contain many imperative operations (e.g. `loadDocument()`, `undo()`, `gotoPosition()`) that cannot be expressed as pure declarative state. Different UI paradigms require different API exposure strategies.

#### 3.0.1 Imperative UI Frameworks

In imperative frameworks (Android View, UIKit, AppKit, Swing, WinForms, etc.), host code can directly hold a reference to the widget instance.

- The APIs in Section 3.2, plus any module-specific public APIs defined in later sections for implemented optional modules, MUST be exposed as public methods directly on the widget entry class (e.g. `SweetEditor`, `SweetEditorView`, `SweetEditorControl`)
- MAY additionally provide `SweetEditorController` to decouple control logic, but this is not required

```java
// Android View
SweetEditor editor = findViewById(R.id.editor);
editor.loadDocument(doc);
editor.applyTheme(EditorTheme.dark());
```

#### 3.0.2 Declarative UI Frameworks

In declarative frameworks (Flutter, Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, ArkUI, etc.), Widgets/Composables are immutable description objects and host code cannot directly hold a widget instance.

`SweetEditor` remains the runtime view/session owner in declarative frameworks. It owns `EditorCore`, provider managers, overlay/runtime objects, timers, listeners, receivers, and other session-scoped state. `SweetEditorController` is the host-owned forwarding entry point used to invoke that runtime; it is not the owner of the bound widget, render runtime, or `EditorCore` instance.

- MUST provide a `SweetEditorController` class as the sole imperative entry point for external control of the editor
- `SweetEditorController` MUST expose the host-facing APIs defined in Section 3.2, plus any module-specific host-facing public APIs from later sections for implemented optional modules
- Section 3.1 `EditorCore` methods are bridge/runtime APIs and MUST NOT be treated as required `SweetEditorController` methods by default
- The widget entry class (e.g. `SweetEditorWidget`, `SweetEditorView`) MUST accept `SweetEditorController` as a constructor parameter
- The controller-to-editor association MUST be established when the editor instance is constructed, and MUST remain fixed for the lifetime of that editor instance
- The widget/session MAY use internal `bind(editorApi)` / `unbind()` hooks, but those hooks represent initial attachment and terminal detachment for that editor instance, not a reusable rebind cycle

```dart
// Flutter
final controller = SweetEditorController();
SweetEditorWidget(controller: controller);
controller.whenReady(() {
    controller.loadDocument(doc);
    controller.applyTheme(EditorTheme.dark());
});
```

#### 3.0.3 `SweetEditorController` Specification

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Controller role | **MUST** | `SweetEditorController` MUST be the host-facing forwarding handle for exactly one declarative editor instance. It MUST NOT be treated as the owner of the bound `View` / `Control` / `Widget`, render runtime, overlay runtime, `EditorCore` lifetime, provider registrations, or any other session-scoped runtime state |
| Lifecycle callback | **MUST** | Provide `whenReady(callback)` method that fires when the widget finishes mounting; if already ready at call time, execute immediately |
| Calls before initial attachment | **MUST** | On declarative platforms, imperative controller calls are not yet available before the associated editor instance completes its initial attachment. Mutating calls MUST be ignored or rejected rather than queued. Getter calls, including `getSettings()`, SHOULD return `null` or default values and MUST NOT throw exceptions. Host code SHOULD invoke imperative controller APIs only after `whenReady()` or an equivalent ready signal. Initial document, theme, settings, key map, or other first-frame configuration that must exist before initial attachment MUST be supplied through declarative construction parameters or an equivalent platform-native initialization path. Platforms MUST NOT create a hidden runtime or hidden staging layer solely to satisfy pre-ready calls |
| Internal attach / detach | **MUST** | Provide an internal attach/detach mechanism (for example `bind(editorApi)` / `unbind()`, though naming MAY vary). These hooks represent initial attachment and terminal detachment for the associated editor instance rather than a reusable rebind protocol |
| Multiple bindings | **MUST** | The same Controller instance MUST NOT be bound to multiple widgets simultaneously, and MUST NOT be rebound to a different widget/session/editor instance after its initial association is established |
| Public API coverage | **MUST** | The Controller MUST expose all required host-facing public operations defined in Section 3.2 and any implemented module-specific host-facing public API tables in later sections |
| API consistency | **SHOULD** | Method names, semantics, and return behavior SHOULD follow the host-facing public API table in Section 3.2 and any implemented module-specific host-facing public API tables in later sections. Platforms MAY additionally provide platform-idiomatic overloads, convenience aliases, or equivalent entry shapes when the mapping to the standard API remains unambiguous |
| Getter methods | **SHOULD** | Before the associated editor instance is ready, or after it reaches terminal teardown, getter methods (e.g. `getDocument()`, `getCursorPosition()`, `getSettings()`) SHOULD return `null` or default values; MUST NOT throw exceptions |
| Explicit teardown (if provided) | **MAY** | Platforms MAY provide an explicit terminal controller teardown method such as `dispose()`, `close()`, or `release()`. This is optional for both GC-managed and non-GC platforms when terminal teardown is already guaranteed by the host lifecycle or by platform-native destruction semantics |
| Explicit teardown semantics | **MUST** | If the platform provides an explicit controller teardown method, it MUST represent terminal controller teardown rather than normal widget lifecycle. It MUST first detach from the associated widget/session if still attached, then release only controller-owned readiness callbacks, internal pending callbacks, and reference chains. It MUST NOT assume ownership of session-owned provider registrations or runtime objects, and MUST NOT directly destroy the `View` / `Control` / `Widget` itself. After teardown, the Controller MUST become terminally inactive: further method calls MUST be no-ops or return default empty values |

> Ordinary declarative rebuilds that preserve the same mounted editor runtime are not considered rebinding. Rebinding means attaching one `SweetEditorController` to a different `SweetEditor` instance, which is not allowed by this standard.

#### 3.0.4 Platform Classification Reference

| UI Paradigm | Frameworks | API Carrier |
|---|---|---|
| Imperative | Android View, UIKit, AppKit, Swing, WinForms | Widget entry class exposes directly |
| Declarative | Flutter, Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, ArkUI, React, Vue | `SweetEditorController` |
| Hybrid | React Native, Qt (QML + C++) | Determined by the primary UI layer paradigm |

> If a platform provides both imperative and declarative APIs (e.g. Apple has both UIKit and SwiftUI), the imperative API is exposed on the widget class, and the declarative wrapper MUST additionally provide a Controller.

#### 3.0.5 Declarative Initialization Inputs

On declarative platforms, the widget entry class MAY expose declarative initialization inputs in addition to the required `controller` constructor parameter. These inputs are part of the declarative widget/view description rather than part of the imperative controller API.

| Input | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `controller` | **MUST** | The `SweetEditorController` associated with the editor instance |
| `document` | **MAY** | Initial `Document` object that should become available to the first attached editor session |
| `text` | **MAY** | Initial plain-text content. If provided without `document`, the platform MUST materialize an equivalent `Document` for the first attached editor session from this text input |
| `theme` | **MAY** | Initial theme that should be applied to the first attached editor session |
| `settings` | **MAY** | Initial settings object or platform-equivalent settings snapshot used to configure the first attached editor session |
| `keyMap` | **MAY** | Initial key map or platform-equivalent keyboard mapping used by the first attached editor session |

The standard does not require identical constructor parameter names, property names, or widget syntax across declarative platforms, but the semantic mapping SHOULD remain unambiguous.

If a declarative platform exposes any of these initialization inputs, they MUST be treated as declarative construction/configuration inputs rather than as pre-ready controller calls. They MUST NOT require a hidden runtime or hidden staging layer. If both `document` and `text` are provided, `document` MUST take precedence and `text` MUST be ignored. If `text` is used without `document`, the platform MUST materialize an equivalent current `Document` for the attached editor session, and `getDocument()` MUST return that materialized `Document` after the editor becomes ready. Subsequent changes to those inputs follow the platform's normal declarative update model. On the same mounted editor runtime, changing `text` has the same semantics as replacing the current document with a newly materialized `Document`. Platforms MAY apply them to the existing mounted editor runtime. If a platform instead requires creation of a new editor instance, host code MUST also provide a new `SweetEditorController` for that new instance. Reusing the same controller with a new editor instance would be controller rebinding and is not allowed by this standard.

---

### 3.1 `EditorCore` Public API

Section 3.1 defines the bridge/runtime API carried by `EditorCore`. It includes low-level render snapshot, gesture loop, keyboard dispatch, and animation tick methods. These methods are not part of the default host-facing editor surface unless a platform explicitly chooses to expose `EditorCore` itself.

> Payload-level APIs (e.g. `setLineSpans`, `setBatchLineSpans`) — all platforms MUST provide high-level typed wrappers (e.g. `setLineSpans(line, layer, spans: List<StyleSpan>)`). Platforms SHOULD additionally expose raw/binary payload APIs when the host language has a natural public binary carrier (e.g. `ByteBuffer`, `NSData`, `byte[]`, `Uint8List`). If both typed and payload APIs are exposed, their parameter semantics and final Core behavior MUST be identical. Payload encoding format remains platform-defined.

#### 3.1.1 `EditorOptions` Standard Fields

`EditorOptions` is a bridge-layer configuration payload. Platforms MAY expose it as a public type or keep it internal, but if it crosses the bridge boundary or is serialized into a binary payload, the following field semantics and ordering MUST remain aligned with Core:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `touchSlop` | float | `10` | Gesture move threshold below which the interaction is still treated as a tap |
| `doubleTapTimeout` | int64 | `300` | Double-tap recognition timeout in milliseconds |
| `longPressMs` | int64 | `500` | Long-press recognition timeout in milliseconds |
| `flingFriction` | float | platform-defined | Fling friction coefficient; platforms MAY tune this to match native interaction feel |
| `flingMinVelocity` | float | platform-defined | Minimum fling velocity in px/s; platforms MAY tune this to match native interaction feel |
| `flingMaxVelocity` | float | platform-defined | Maximum fling velocity in px/s; platforms MAY tune this to match native interaction feel |
| `maxUndoStackSize` | uint64 / size_t-aligned integer | `512` | Maximum undo stack depth; `0` means unlimited |
| `keyChordTimeoutMs` | int64 | `2000` | Timeout for completing a pending multi-chord key binding |
| `revealSelectionEndOnSelectAll` | boolean | `false` | When true, `selectAll()` SHOULD reveal the selection end after updating the selection |

> If a platform serializes `EditorOptions` into a binary bridge payload, field order MUST stay aligned with Core: `touch_slop`, `double_tap_timeout`, `long_press_ms`, `fling_friction`, `fling_min_velocity`, `fling_max_velocity`, `max_undo_stack_size`, `key_chord_timeout_ms`, `reveal_selection_end_on_select_all`.

### 3.2 Host-Facing Editor Public API

Section 3.2 defines the host-facing editor API. It intentionally excludes low-level `EditorCore` gesture-loop, animation-tick, and render-model production methods such as `handleGestureEvent(...)`, `tickEdgeScroll()`, and `buildRenderModel()`. `flush()` remains part of this layer as the host-triggered synchronization API. On imperative platforms this API is exposed directly by the widget entry class; on declarative platforms it is exposed by `SweetEditorController` and forwards to the associated `SweetEditor` runtime without implying controller-side ownership of editor/session state. Except for `whenReady(...)` itself and equivalent readiness helpers, imperative controller calls on declarative platforms are only valid after the associated editor instance becomes ready. Initial document, theme, settings, key map, or other first-frame configuration that must exist before initial attachment MUST be supplied through declarative construction parameters or an equivalent platform-native initialization path.

> The canonical naming for provider management methods is `add` / `remove`. Each platform MAY use semantically equivalent variants per its own conventions (e.g. `attach` / `detach`, `register` / `unregister`).

> Clipboard methods (`copyToClipboard`, `pasteFromClipboard`, `cutToClipboard`) are **MAY** because clipboard access is platform-specific.

> Event exposure does not require a uniform method shape. Platforms MUST provide a type-safe event mechanism per Section 11, and may use `subscribe` / `unsubscribe`, platform-native `event` / delegates, typed `Stream` getters, signals / observers, or equivalent forms.

> Section 3.2 is the host-facing editor public API index. Some module-specific interfaces, data models, and callback contracts are further specified in later sections (for example Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10); Sections 4, 5, and 10 define required-module contracts, while Sections 6 and 7 define optional or conditional module contracts.

---

## 4. Provider Interfaces (MUST)

> **General rules:**
> - `provideDecorations` and `provideCompletions` MUST support both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** result delivery
> - `DecorationProvider` MUST support multi-shot result delivery so a single request may yield zero, one, or multiple successive snapshots
> - `CompletionProvider` MUST support at least single-shot result delivery, and MAY support multi-shot / incremental result updates
> - In-flight decoration / completion requests MUST have an explicit cancellation / staleness contract; once a request becomes cancelled or stale, any late result from that request MUST be ignored
> - Platforms MAY expose provider results via a Receiver callback, `Future` / `Promise` / `Task`, coroutine / `suspend` API, stream / observable, or another platform-idiomatic async form
> - The **Receiver callback pattern remains the recommended public shape** because it naturally supports sync return, async return, multi-shot updates, and cancellation checks in one contract
> - If the platform does not expose the Receiver shape, it MUST still document how its chosen API expresses immediate delivery, deferred delivery, multi-shot updates where applicable, and cancellation / staleness
> - Multiple instances of the same Provider type can be registered; the Manager is responsible for iterating and merging results
> - The provider-manager pattern (register -> iterate -> dispatch) MUST be consistent across all platforms

### 4.1 DecorationProvider

#### Recommended Receiver Signature

```
interface DecorationProvider {
    getCapabilities() -> Set<DecorationType>
    provideDecorations(context: DecorationContext, receiver: DecorationReceiver) -> void
}

interface DecorationReceiver {
    accept(result: DecorationResult) -> boolean
    isCancelled() -> boolean
}
```

> Platforms MAY expose a semantically equivalent async API instead of an explicit `DecorationReceiver`, but the contract MUST still support immediate results, deferred results, and cancellation / staleness checks. If an explicit Receiver type is exposed, `DecorationReceiver` is the recommended name.

#### DecorationContext MUST Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `visibleLineRange` | IntRange | Line range for the current decoration context. It usually matches the visible lines, but platforms MAY expand it with overscan or other heuristics |
| `totalLineCount` | int | Total line count of the document |
| `textChanges` | List\<TextChange\> | Text changes accumulated during this refresh cycle; empty list means non-text-change trigger |
| `languageConfiguration` | LanguageConfiguration? | Current language configuration (nullable) |
| `editorMetadata` | EditorMetadata? | Current editor metadata (nullable) |

#### ApplyMode Enum (MUST)

Each decoration data type MUST have a corresponding `ApplyMode` that controls how the Manager merges results:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `MERGE` | Merge with existing data (default) |
| `REPLACE_ALL` | Replace all existing data |
| `REPLACE_RANGE` | Replace only data within `visibleLineRange` (the current decoration context range) |

When multiple Providers return different ApplyModes, the Manager MUST use the highest priority: `REPLACE_ALL` > `REPLACE_RANGE` > `MERGE`.

#### DecorationResult MUST Fields

`DecorationResult` contains 13 decoration data types, each with a corresponding `ApplyMode` (default `MERGE`). Data types MUST use the standard types defined in the Core layer (e.g. `StyleSpan`, `InlayHint`, `CodeLensItem`, `LinkSpan`, `Diagnostic`, etc.).

| Data Field | Type | ApplyMode Field |
|---|---|---|
| `syntaxSpans` | Map\<int, List\<StyleSpan\>\>? | `syntaxSpansMode` |
| `semanticSpans` | Map\<int, List\<StyleSpan\>\>? | `semanticSpansMode` |
| `inlayHints` | Map\<int, List\<InlayHint\>\>? | `inlayHintsMode` |
| `diagnostics` | Map\<int, List\<Diagnostic\>\>? | `diagnosticsMode` |
| `indentGuides` | List\<IndentGuide\>? | `indentGuidesMode` |
| `bracketGuides` | List\<BracketGuide\>? | `bracketGuidesMode` |
| `flowGuides` | List\<FlowGuide\>? | `flowGuidesMode` |
| `separatorGuides` | List\<SeparatorGuide\>? | `separatorGuidesMode` |
| `foldRegions` | List\<FoldRegion\>? | `foldRegionsMode` |
| `gutterIcons` | Map\<int, List\<GutterIcon\>\>? | `gutterIconsMode` |
| `phantomTexts` | Map\<int, List\<PhantomText\>\>? | `phantomTextsMode` |
| `codeLensItems` | Map\<int, List\<CodeLensItem\>\>? | `codeLensItemsMode` |
| `links` | Map\<int, List\<LinkSpan\>\>? | `linksMode` |

> Line-indexed data (syntaxSpans, semanticSpans, etc.) uses `Map<int, List<T>>` where the key is the line number (0-based).

#### DecorationType Enum (MUST)

Platforms MUST include `CODELENS` and `LINK` in `DecorationType` when exposing the decoration capability set.

#### Multi-Provider Merge Strategy

The Manager iterates all registered Providers and merges each Provider's snapshot according to ApplyMode:
- `MERGE`: append and merge same-type data from each Provider
- `REPLACE_ALL`: clear all existing data first, then write new data
- `REPLACE_RANGE`: clear only existing data within `visibleLineRange` (the current decoration context range), then write new data

### 4.2 CompletionProvider

#### Recommended Receiver Signature

```
interface CompletionProvider {
    isTriggerCharacter(ch: String) -> boolean
    provideCompletions(context: CompletionContext, receiver: CompletionReceiver) -> void
}

interface CompletionReceiver {
    accept(result: CompletionResult) -> boolean
    isCancelled() -> boolean
}
```

> Platforms MAY expose a semantically equivalent async API instead of an explicit `CompletionReceiver`, but the contract MUST still support immediate results, deferred results, and cancellation / staleness checks. If an explicit Receiver type is exposed, `CompletionReceiver` is the recommended name.

#### CompletionTriggerKind Enum (MUST)

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `INVOKED` | User manually triggered (e.g. Ctrl+Space) |
| `CHARACTER` | Trigger character entered (e.g. `.`) |
| `RETRIGGER` | Re-trigger after content change |

#### CompletionContext MUST Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `triggerKind` | CompletionTriggerKind | Trigger type |
| `triggerCharacter` | String? | Trigger character (nullable, only set for CHARACTER type) |
| `cursorPosition` | TextPosition | Cursor position |
| `lineText` | String | Current line text |
| `wordRange` | TextRange | Word range at cursor |
| `languageConfiguration` | LanguageConfiguration? | Current language configuration (nullable) |
| `editorMetadata` | EditorMetadata? | Current editor metadata (nullable) |

#### CompletionResult MUST Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `items` | List\<CompletionItem\> | List of completion items |
| `isIncomplete` | boolean | Whether the result is incomplete (true means subsequent input should re-request) |

#### Multi-Provider Merge and Sort Strategy

The Manager iterates all Providers, merges the `CompletionItem` lists returned by each Provider, and sorts by `sortKey` (falling back to `label`).

### 4.3 NewLineActionProvider

#### Interface Signature

```
interface NewLineActionProvider {
    provideNewLineAction(context: NewLineContext) -> NewLineAction?
}
```

> `NewLineActionProvider` remains synchronous because newline handling is part of the immediate input path.

#### NewLineContext MUST Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `lineNumber` | int | Caret line number (0-based) |
| `column` | int | Caret column (0-based) |
| `lineText` | String | Current line text |
| `languageConfiguration` | LanguageConfiguration? | Current language configuration (nullable) |
| `editorMetadata` | EditorMetadata? | Current editor metadata (nullable) |

#### NewLineAction MUST Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | String | Full text to insert (including newline and indentation) |

#### Multi-Provider Chain Priority Strategy

The Manager iterates all Providers in registration order and returns the first non-null `NewLineAction`. If all Providers return null, the default newline behavior is used.
## 5. `CompletionItem` Field Definitions (MUST)

`CompletionItem` is the core data type of the completion system. Application priority on commit: `textEdit` → `insertText` → `label`.

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | String | **MUST** | Display label (used for list display and fallback insertion) |
| `detail` | String? | **MAY** | Detailed description (displayed to the right of or below the label) |
| `insertText` | String? | **MAY** | Insert text (takes priority over `label` for insertion) |
| `insertTextFormat` | int | **MUST** | Insert text format: `PLAIN_TEXT=1` (default), `SNIPPET=2` (VSCode Snippet format, supports `$1`, `${1:default}`, `$0` placeholders) |
| `textEdit` | CompletionTextEdit? | **MAY** | Precise replacement edit (specifies replacement range + new text), highest priority |
| `filterText` | String? | **MAY** | Filter/match text (falls back to `label` when null) |
| `sortKey` | String? | **MAY** | Sort key (falls back to `label` when null) |
| `kind` | int | **MUST** | Completion item kind (affects icon display) |

**Kind constants (MUST):**

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| `KIND_KEYWORD` | 0 |
| `KIND_FUNCTION` | 1 |
| `KIND_VARIABLE` | 2 |
| `KIND_CLASS` | 3 |
| `KIND_INTERFACE` | 4 |
| `KIND_MODULE` | 5 |
| `KIND_PROPERTY` | 6 |
| `KIND_SNIPPET` | 7 |
| `KIND_TEXT` | 8 |

**`CompletionTextEdit`** sub-type:

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `range` | TextRange | **MUST** | Replacement range |
| `newText` | String | **MUST** | Replacement text |

---

## 6. Copilot / InlineSuggestion Interface Definition (SHOULD)

The inline suggestion (Copilot) module is SHOULD level, but when implemented MUST follow the interface specification below.

### 6.1 `InlineSuggestion` Data Type

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `line` | int | **MUST** | Target line number (0-based) |
| `column` | int | **MUST** | Insertion column (0-based, UTF-16 offset) |
| `text` | String | **MUST** | Suggestion text content |

> `InlineSuggestion` SHOULD be an immutable object.

### 6.2 Inline Suggestion Callback Contract

Platforms MUST provide a host-visible way to observe inline suggestion acceptance and dismissal.

Platforms MAY use any of the following forms:
- An explicit listener interface
- Delegate / closure / callback setters
- Platform-native events / typed streams / signals

If a platform exposes an explicit listener interface, the recommended shape is:

```
interface InlineSuggestionListener {
    onSuggestionAccepted(suggestion: InlineSuggestion) -> void
    onSuggestionDismissed(suggestion: InlineSuggestion) -> void
}
```

The callback contract MUST satisfy all of the following:
- A visible inline suggestion MUST have two distinct host-visible events: `accepted` and `dismissed`
- `accepted` payload MUST include the accepted `InlineSuggestion` value, or an equivalent payload from which the same suggestion can be unambiguously identified
- `dismissed` payload MUST include the dismissed `InlineSuggestion` value, or an equivalent payload / identifier, unless the platform's callback form is a no-payload dismissed signal and that limitation is explicitly documented
- For a single shown suggestion instance, `accepted` MUST fire at most once and `dismissed` MUST fire at most once
- After either `accepted` or `dismissed` fires for a shown suggestion instance, no further callbacks for that same suggestion instance MAY be emitted
- If `showInlineSuggestion()` replaces an already-visible suggestion, the platform MAY either emit `dismissed` for the previous suggestion before switching, or replace it quietly without a `dismissed` callback; in either case the previous suggestion instance MUST NOT emit further callbacks after replacement
- After terminal editor teardown, internal detach, or controller disposal, no further host-visible inline-suggestion callbacks MAY be emitted

| Callback | Constraint | Trigger Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `onSuggestionAccepted` | **MUST** | When the user accepts the currently visible suggestion |
| `onSuggestionDismissed` | **MUST** | When the user dismisses the currently visible suggestion |

### 6.3 Host-Facing Copilot API

| Method | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `showInlineSuggestion(suggestion)` | **MUST** | Show the inline suggestion and make it available for accept / dismiss interaction |
| `dismissInlineSuggestion()` | **MUST** | Dismiss the current inline suggestion and remove its visible presentation |
| `isInlineSuggestionShowing()` | **MUST** | Query whether an inline suggestion is currently showing |
| `setInlineSuggestionListener(listener)` | **MUST** | Register the host-visible accepted / dismissed listener; passing `null` clears it |

> Platforms MAY expose semantically equivalent APIs such as `setInlineSuggestionCallbacks(callbacks)`, delegate setters, event subscriptions, or typed streams.

### 6.4 Auto-dismiss Behavior

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Text change | **MUST** | MUST automatically dismiss the current inline suggestion when the user types text |
| Cursor movement | **MUST** | MUST automatically dismiss the current inline suggestion when the cursor position changes |
| Scrolling | **SHOULD** | SHOULD update the visible suggestion affordance position on scroll when applicable; SHOULD NOT auto-dismiss |

### 6.5 `InlineSuggestionController` (MAY)

`InlineSuggestionController` is the recommended internal implementation pattern (see Section 1.3), responsible for managing the complete lifecycle of inline suggestions:

- Suggestion presentation and removal
- Event listener (TextChanged / CursorChanged / ScrollChanged) subscription and unsubscription
- Accept / dismiss interaction and any associated visual affordance positioning
- Accept / dismiss key handling where applicable

Platforms MAY choose not to use the Controller pattern, but MUST implement equivalent functionality.

---

## 7. Selection / SelectionMenu Interface Definition (SHOULD on mobile, desktop MAY omit)

On mobile platforms, the selection menu module is SHOULD level. Desktop platforms MAY omit it entirely. If implemented, it MUST follow the contract below.

### 7.1 `SelectionMenuItem` Data Type

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | String | **MUST** | Stable action identifier used by host code to distinguish menu items |
| `label` | String | **MUST** | Display text shown in the menu |
| `enabled` | boolean | **MAY** | Whether the menu item is currently actionable; defaults to enabled if omitted |
| `iconId` | int? | **MAY** | Optional icon resource ID when the platform supports icons in the selection menu |

> `SelectionMenuItem` is the shared menu-item data model. If a platform exposes standard actions, the recommended built-in `id` values are `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, and `select_all`; custom actions MAY use any stable `id`.

### 7.2 `SelectionMenuItemProvider`

The standard provider shape is:

```
interface SelectionMenuItemProvider {
    provideMenuItems(editor) -> List<SelectionMenuItem>
}
```

`editor` refers to the platform's host-facing editor/widget object. Platforms MAY expose
additional provider parameters, but the provider is expected to build the full selection menu
from the current editor state rather than from an incremental patch payload.

Selection-menu semantics:
- The provider returns the complete menu model for the current show cycle, rather than incremental appended items
- When the provider is `null`, the platform SHOULD restore the default selection menu
- When the provider returns an empty list, the platform MAY choose not to show a selection menu
- The provider SHOULD be invoked again immediately before the menu is shown so items can reflect the current editor state

### 7.3 Selection Menu Callback Contract

Platforms that implement `SelectionMenu` MUST provide a host-visible way to observe custom selection-menu item activation. Platforms MAY use an explicit listener interface, delegate / closure / callback setters, or platform-native events / typed streams / signals.

If a platform exposes an explicit listener interface, the recommended shape is:

```
interface SelectionMenuListener {
    onSelectionMenuItemSelected(itemId: String) -> void
}
```

The callback contract MUST satisfy all of the following:
- Host-visible callbacks MAY cover custom menu items only; built-in cut / copy / paste / select-all actions are not required to emit a unified `item-selected` callback
- The `item-selected` payload SHOULD include the selected custom item's `itemId`, or an equivalent payload from which that menu item can be unambiguously identified
- The standard does not require a host-visible `dismissed` event for selection menus
- After terminal editor teardown, internal detach, or controller disposal, no further host-visible custom selection-menu callbacks MAY be emitted

### 7.4 Host-Facing Selection API

| Method | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `setSelectionMenuItemProvider(provider)` | **MUST** | Configure custom selection-menu items; passing `null` restores the platform default menu |

> Platforms MAY expose semantically equivalent APIs such as `setSelectionMenuListener(listener)`, custom-item click event subscriptions, delegate setters, or typed streams. Platforms MAY additionally expose read-only query APIs such as `isSelectionMenuShowing()`, but the standard does not require them.

### 7.5 Positioning and Lifetime

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Selection anchor | **MUST** | When visible, the menu MUST be anchored to the current selection / caret geometry or an equivalent platform-native selection affordance |
| Selection invalidation | **MUST** | If the selection becomes empty, invalid, or detached from the current document state, the menu MUST dismiss |
| Scroll / viewport change | **SHOULD** | Scrolling or viewport changes SHOULD update the menu position; they SHOULD NOT require dismiss unless the platform cannot reposition safely |
| Command completion | **SHOULD** | After the user activates a selection-menu command, the menu SHOULD dismiss unless the platform intentionally keeps it open for a multi-step workflow |

### 7.6 `SelectionMenuController` (MAY)

`SelectionMenuController` is the recommended internal implementation pattern for mobile selection menus. It may manage item updates, visibility, positioning, and callback dispatch, but platforms MAY implement equivalent behavior directly in the widget layer.

---

## 8. EditorTheme (MUST)

All platforms MUST define `EditorTheme` with the following color fields. Field names follow Section 2.2 casing rules.

### 8.3 Factory Methods

Every platform MUST provide at least `dark()` and `light()` factory methods that return pre-configured themes.

### 8.4 TextStyle Map

Every `EditorTheme` MUST contain a `textStyles` map (`Map<int, TextStyle>`) and a `defineTextStyle(styleId, style)` method.

---

## 9. EditorSettings (MUST)

Editor options and behavior/layout configuration MUST be centralized through the `EditorSettings` object. This includes settings-like editor options such as wrap mode, scale, composition behavior, spacing, padding, and similar editor-option fields. `EditorTheme` and `EditorKeyMap` remain separate host-facing configuration objects and are not folded into `EditorSettings` by this rule. The host-facing API carrier MUST NOT directly expose settings-like configuration setters (e.g. `setWrapMode`, `setScale`, `setCompositionEnabled`). Instead, it exposes a `getSettings()` method, and callers configure those settings through that object once it is available. On imperative platforms the host-facing carrier is `SweetEditor`; on declarative platforms it is `SweetEditorController`. On declarative platforms, `getSettings()` becomes valid only after `whenReady()` or an equivalent ready signal. Before that point it SHOULD return `null` or a default unavailable value, MUST NOT create a hidden runtime or hidden staging object, and MUST NOT be treated as a pre-ready configuration channel. Initial settings required before first attachment MUST be supplied through declarative construction parameters or an equivalent platform-native initialization path. This host-facing rule does not change the `EditorCore` public API defined in Section 3.1.

All platforms MUST expose the following settings through getter/setter pairs (or properties):

| Field | Type | Default | setter | getter | Effect | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `editorTextSize` | float | Platform-dependent | `setEditorTextSize(size)` | `getEditorTextSize()` | `relayout` | Editor text size |
| `typeface` / `fontFamily` | Platform font type | `monospace` | `setTypeface(typeface)` / `setFontFamily(family)` | `getTypeface()` / `getFontFamily()` | `relayout` | Font family |
| `scale` | float | 1.0 | `setScale(scale)` | `getScale()` | `relayout` | Scale factor |
| `foldArrowMode` | FoldArrowMode | ALWAYS | `setFoldArrowMode(mode)` | `getFoldArrowMode()` | `repaint` | Fold arrow display mode |
| `wrapMode` | WrapMode | NONE | `setWrapMode(mode)` | `getWrapMode()` | `relayout` | Auto-wrap mode |
| `compositionEnabled` | boolean | Platform-dependent | `setCompositionEnabled(enabled)` | `isCompositionEnabled()` | `runtime-transition` | Whether IME composition mode is enabled |
| `lineSpacingAdd` | float | 0 | `setLineSpacing(add, mult)` | `getLineSpacingAdd()` | `relayout` | Line spacing extra (pixels) |
| `lineSpacingMult` | float | 1.0 | *(same as above)* | `getLineSpacingMult()` | `relayout` | Line spacing multiplier |
| `contentStartPadding` | float | Platform-dependent | `setContentStartPadding(padding)` | `getContentStartPadding()` | `relayout` | Extra horizontal padding between gutter split and text rendering start (pixels) |
| `showSplitLine` | boolean | true | `setShowSplitLine(show)` | `isShowSplitLine()` | `repaint` | Whether to render the gutter split line |
| `gutterSticky` | boolean | Platform-dependent | `setGutterSticky(sticky)` | `isGutterSticky()` | `repaint` | Whether gutter stays fixed during horizontal scroll (true=fixed, false=scrolls with content) |
| `gutterVisible` | boolean | true | `setGutterVisible(visible)` | `isGutterVisible()` | `relayout` | Whether gutter area is visible (false=hide line numbers, icons, fold arrows) |
| `currentLineRenderMode` | CurrentLineRenderMode | BACKGROUND | `setCurrentLineRenderMode(mode)` | `getCurrentLineRenderMode()` | `repaint` | Current line render mode |
| `autoIndentMode` | AutoIndentMode | KEEP_INDENT | `setAutoIndentMode(mode)` | `getAutoIndentMode()` | `runtime-transition` | Auto indent mode |
| `backspaceUnindent` | boolean | true | `setBackspaceUnindent(enabled)` | `isBackspaceUnindent()` | `runtime-transition` | Whether backspace key unindents at line start |
| `readOnly` | boolean | false | `setReadOnly(readOnly)` | `isReadOnly()` | `runtime-transition` | Read-only mode, blocks all edit operations |
| `maxGutterIcons` | int | 0 | `setMaxGutterIcons(count)` | `getMaxGutterIcons()` | `relayout` | Maximum gutter icon count |
| `decorationScrollRefreshMinIntervalMs` | long | 16 | `setDecorationScrollRefreshMinIntervalMs(ms)` | `getDecorationScrollRefreshMinIntervalMs()` | `provider-policy` | Decoration scroll refresh minimum interval (ms) |
| `decorationOverscanViewportMultiplier` | float | 1.5 | `setDecorationOverscanViewportMultiplier(mult)` | `getDecorationOverscanViewportMultiplier()` | `provider-policy` | Decoration overscan viewport multiplier |

> All setter calls MUST take effect immediately.
>
> Effect classification:
> - `repaint`: MUST trigger an immediate repaint or equivalent visual refresh, without requiring text relayout.
> - `relayout`: MUST trigger layout invalidation and rebuild the render model or an equivalent relayout path immediately.
> - `runtime-transition`: MUST apply immediately and safely handle active runtime state transitions required by the setting. A `runtime-transition` setting does not require repaint or relayout unless the current visible state actually changes.
> - `provider-policy`: MUST immediately affect subsequent provider scheduling / refresh behavior. It does not require repaint or relayout unless the implementation explicitly triggers a refresh as part of applying the new policy.
>
> `compositionEnabled` is the canonical example of `runtime-transition`: when switching from enabled to disabled while an IME composition is active, the platform MUST cancel or otherwise safely terminate the active composition before the new setting takes effect.
>
> `contentStartPadding` is platform-dependent by default. It MUST be `>= 0`. `0` is the neutral baseline, but platforms MAY choose a non-zero visual default.
>
> `gutterSticky` is platform-dependent by default. Desktop-style platforms SHOULD default to `true`; mobile / touch-first platforms SHOULD default to `false`.
>
> `autoIndentMode`, `backspaceUnindent`, and `readOnly` are also `runtime-transition` settings. They MUST affect subsequent editing behavior immediately, but they do not require `flush()`, repaint, or relayout if no visible state changes at the moment of the setter call.

---

## 10. Keymap / Shortcut Mapping (MUST)

### 10.1 Core Data Model

All platforms MUST provide the core-layer keymap types `KeyMap`, `KeyBinding`, `KeyChord`, `KeyCode`, `KeyModifier`, and `EditorCommand`.

- `KeyMap` MUST be a pure data mapping from `KeyBinding` to command id
- `KeyBinding` MUST support both single-chord and two-chord bindings
- `KeyChord` MUST represent one key press as `modifiers + keyCode`
- Single-chord bindings MUST encode the second chord as an empty / none chord
- `EditorCore.setKeyMap(keyMap)` MUST sync the full binding table to the C++ core

### 10.2 Numeric Alignment

If the platform exposes `KeyCode`, `KeyModifier`, or built-in `EditorCommand` constants, their numeric values MUST align with the C++ core.

- `KeyModifier` MUST use bit flags so combined modifiers can be represented by bitwise OR
- `KeyCode.NONE`, the empty second chord, and `EditorCommand.NONE` MUST preserve the same semantics as the C++ core
- `EditorCore`, bridge layers, or FFI layers MAY continue using raw integer enum values aligned with the C++ core as internal transport representations
- For such bridge-layer integer enums, platforms are not required to repeat host-facing business-level enum validation, but MUST ensure invalid input cannot cause native / C++ crashes or undefined behavior

### 10.3 Widget-Layer Extension

- `SweetEditor` MUST support `setKeyMap(keyMap)` and SHOULD expose `getKeyMap()`
- Platforms MUST expose `EditorKeyMap` as a widget-layer extension of `KeyMap` so host code can additionally bind command ids to host-side handlers
- `EditorKeyMap` MUST support `registerCommand(binding, handler)`
- If `binding.command == EditorCommand.NONE`, `registerCommand(binding, handler)` MUST auto-assign a custom command id and return it
- Platforms MAY additionally expose convenience APIs for custom-command registration, but `registerCommand(binding, handler)` remains the canonical contract
- Auto-assigned custom command ids MUST be greater than `BUILT_IN_MAX`
- Platforms MUST provide `defaultKeyMap()` as the default binding factory
- Platforms MUST provide `vscode()`, and `defaultKeyMap()` MUST be semantically equivalent to `vscode()`
- Platforms SHOULD provide named preset factories such as `jetbrains()` and `sublime()`
- `SweetEditor.setKeyMap()` MUST replace the current keymap and make the new bindings immediately effective
- Widget-layer handlers remain platform-side and are not serialized to the C++ core
- If a platform does not expose `getKeyMap()`, its documentation MUST clearly describe how host code constructs and replaces the active keymap

---

## 11. Event System (MUST)

### 11.1 Event Mechanism

All platforms MUST provide a **type-safe** editor event exposure mechanism so host code can observe specific event types and manage subscription lifecycle through unsubscribe / dispose / cancel-listening or an equivalent operation.

Platforms MAY use any of the following forms:
- `EditorEventBus` + `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `publish` / `clear`
- Platform-native event / delegate / listener mechanisms (for example C# `event`, Java listener callbacks)
- Typed stream / signal / observable getters (for example Dart `Stream<T>`)

If a platform adopts an explicit event-bus/listener pattern, the related public types SHOULD be named `EditorEventBus` / `EditorEventListener`.

### 11.2 Required Event Types

All platforms MUST support the following event types:

```
TextChangedEvent, CursorChangedEvent, SelectionChangedEvent,
ScrollChangedEvent, ScaleChangedEvent, DocumentLoadedEvent,
FoldToggleEvent, GutterIconClickEvent, InlayHintClickEvent, CodeLensClickEvent, LinkClickEvent,
LongPressEvent,       // mobile only (iOS/Android)
DoubleTapEvent,
ContextMenuEvent      // platforms with an explicit context-menu gesture entry point
```

> `LongPressEvent` is for mobile platforms (iOS/Android) and represents the raw long-press gesture itself. `ContextMenuEvent` is for platforms that expose an explicit context-menu gesture entry point (for example desktop right click or a framework-native context-menu gesture). Platform implementations SHOULD only register events relevant to their platform.

> The above event types MUST be distinguishable and consumable in a type-safe way through the platform's chosen event mechanism.

Platform-specific events (e.g. `SelectionMenuItemClickEvent` on mobile) MAY be added.

### 11.3 Event Payload Contract

Event payloads MUST be defined per-event. Platforms MUST NOT assume or require a shared base payload schema beyond the event type itself.

| Event | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TextChangedEvent` | `changes: List<TextChange>`, `action: TextChangeAction?` *(SHOULD)* | Incremental text changes for the current edit cycle; `action` is an optional coarse-grained semantic hint |
| `CursorChangedEvent` | `cursorPosition: TextPosition` | Current cursor position |
| `SelectionChangedEvent` | `hasSelection: boolean`, `selection: TextRange?`, `cursorPosition: TextPosition` | Current selection state and cursor position |
| `ScrollChangedEvent` | `scrollX: float`, `scrollY: float` | Current view scroll offset |
| `ScaleChangedEvent` | `scale: float` | Current editor scale |
| `DocumentLoadedEvent` | — | No payload fields are required |
| `FoldToggleEvent` | `line: int`, `isGutter: boolean`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Toggled fold line, whether the click came from gutter, and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `GutterIconClickEvent` | `line: int`, `iconId: int`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Clicked gutter icon line, icon id, and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `InlayHintClickEvent` | `line: int`, `column: int`, `type: InlayType`, `intValue: int`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Clicked inlay hint position, inlay type, type-specific value, and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `CodeLensClickEvent` | `line: int`, `column: int`, `commandId: int`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Clicked CodeLens line/column anchor, unique command id, and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `LinkClickEvent` | `line: int`, `column: int`, `target: String`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Clicked link line/column anchor, resolved link target, and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `LongPressEvent` | `cursorPosition: TextPosition`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Raw long-press target position and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `DoubleTapEvent` | `cursorPosition: TextPosition`, `hasSelection: boolean`, `selection: TextRange?`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Double-tap target position, resulting selection state, and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `ContextMenuEvent` | `cursorPosition: TextPosition`, `locationInEditor: PointF or platform-native point type` | Explicit context-menu gesture target position and pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `ContextMenuItemClickEvent` *(platform-specific)* | `item: ContextMenuItem`, `request: ContextMenuRequest` | Clicked custom context-menu item and the immutable request snapshot used to build that menu |
| `SelectionMenuItemClickEvent` *(platform-specific)* | `item: SelectionMenuItem` | Clicked custom selection-menu item |

### 11.4 Gesture Result Contract

Platforms MAY expose the raw return value of `handleGestureEvent(...)` / `handleGestureEventEx(...)` or MAY consume it internally, but if it is surfaced in public APIs or platform-internal bridge types, the following fields MUST preserve the Core semantics:

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hitTarget` | `HitTargetType` + platform-aligned payload | **MUST** | Hit-test result for the current gesture location |
| `pointerCursorType` | `PointerCursorType` | **MUST** on desktop, **MAY** on touch-only platforms | Pointer cursor hint for the current mouse location |

> Desktop platforms SHOULD apply `pointerCursorType` immediately after gesture processing for responsive cursor updates. Touch-only platforms MAY omit this field entirely, or ignore the visual cursor change if they still surface it for compatibility.

### 11.5 ContextMenu Standard Contract

`ContextMenu` is a widget-layer, platform-side UI capability. It MUST NOT be modeled as a C++ Core render-model concept or serialized as a Core decoration type. If a platform implements context menus, it MUST follow the following standard data model and semantics.

#### Recommended Types

```
enum ContextMenuTriggerKind {
    LONG_PRESS,
    RIGHT_CLICK
}

interface ContextMenuItemProvider {
    provideMenuItems(request: ContextMenuRequest) -> List<ContextMenuSection>
}
```

#### `ContextMenuRequest` MUST Fields

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `triggerKind` | `ContextMenuTriggerKind` | **MUST** | Trigger kind for the current menu show cycle |
| `cursorPosition` | `TextPosition` | **MUST** | Caret position after the triggering gesture resolves |
| `locationInEditor` | `PointF or platform-native point type` | **MUST** | Pointer location relative to the editor's local coordinate space |
| `hasSelection` | boolean | **MUST** | Whether the editor has a non-empty selection |
| `selection` | `TextRange?` | **MAY** | Current selection snapshot; `null` when `hasSelection == false` |
| `hitTarget` | platform-aligned `HitTarget` payload | **MUST** | Hit-test result at the trigger location |
| `linkTarget` | String | **MAY** | Resolved link target when `hitTarget` is `LINK`; empty string when not applicable |

#### `ContextMenuItem` MUST Fields

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | String | **MUST** | Stable action identifier |
| `label` | String | **MUST** | Primary display text |
| `secondaryLabel` | String? | **MAY** | Optional secondary text shown on the same row |
| `enabled` | boolean | **MAY** | Whether the item is currently actionable; defaults to enabled if omitted |
| `icon` | platform-native leading icon object or equivalent | **MAY** | Optional leading icon. This SHOULD be a platform-native image object, not a cross-platform numeric icon id |

#### `ContextMenuSection` MUST Fields

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items` | `List<ContextMenuItem>` | **MUST** | Full list of menu items in that section |

Context-menu semantics:
- `LongPressEvent` and/or `ContextMenuEvent` MAY be the trigger signal; `ContextMenuRequest` is the immutable snapshot used to build the actual menu model
- The provider returns the complete menu model for the current show cycle, rather than incremental appended items
- Passing `null` as the provider SHOULD restore the platform default context menu
- Returning an empty list MAY suppress the menu for that show cycle
- `locationInEditor` MUST remain editor-local; platforms convert it to screen / window coordinates only when presenting a popup or native menu
- A platform MAY open a context menu from `LongPressEvent` without publishing `ContextMenuEvent`; in that case `ContextMenuRequest.triggerKind` MUST still be `LONG_PRESS`
- If `hitTarget == LINK` and `linkTarget` is non-empty, the default menu SHOULD include built-in actions `open_link` and `copy_link`
- If `hasSelection == true`, the default menu SHOULD include built-in actions `cut` and `copy`
- The general/default section SHOULD include built-in actions `paste` and `select_all`
- `ContextMenuItem.icon` MAY be null; if a given menu contains any icon-bearing rows, platforms SHOULD reserve a consistent leading icon slot for visual alignment
- The platform MUST provide a host-visible way to observe custom item activation via `ContextMenuItemClickEvent` or an equivalent callback payload
- After command execution, text change, or another gesture that invalidates the current target, the menu SHOULD dismiss unless the platform intentionally supports a persistent multi-step workflow

Platforms that implement `ContextMenu` MUST expose a host-facing API equivalent to `setContextMenuItemProvider(provider)`.

---

## 12. Enumeration and Constant Values (MUST)

Enum and enum-like constant values MUST match the C++ core definitions. The following groups MUST remain aligned with the C++ core across all platforms. When explicit numeric values are listed below, platforms MUST use those same values. When a row lists only member names or says it is aligned with the C++ core, platforms MUST still match the corresponding core definition.

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `WrapMode` | NONE=0, CHAR_BREAK=1, WORD_BREAK=2 |
| `FoldArrowMode` | AUTO=0, ALWAYS=1, HIDDEN=2 |
| `AutoIndentMode` | NONE=0, KEEP_INDENT=1 |
| `CurrentLineRenderMode` | BACKGROUND=0, BORDER=1, NONE=2 |
| `ScrollBehavior` | TOP=0, CENTER=1, BOTTOM=2 |
| `SpanLayer` | SYNTAX=0, SEMANTIC=1 |
| `InlayType` | TEXT=0, ICON=1, COLOR=2 |
| `VisualRunType` | TEXT=0, WHITESPACE=1, NEWLINE=2, INLAY_HINT=3, PHANTOM_TEXT=4, FOLD_PLACEHOLDER=5, TAB=6, CODELENS=7, LINK=8 |

| `PointerCursorType` | DEFAULT=0, TEXT=1, HAND=2 |
| `FoldState` | NONE=0, EXPANDED=1, COLLAPSED=2 |
| `DecorationType` | SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT, SEMANTIC_HIGHLIGHT, INLAY_HINT, DIAGNOSTIC, FOLD_REGION, INDENT_GUIDE, BRACKET_GUIDE, FLOW_GUIDE, SEPARATOR_GUIDE, GUTTER_ICON, PHANTOM_TEXT, CODELENS, LINK |
| `HitTargetType` | NONE=0, INLAY_HINT_TEXT=1, INLAY_HINT_ICON=2, GUTTER_ICON=3, FOLD_PLACEHOLDER=4, FOLD_GUTTER=5, INLAY_HINT_COLOR=6, CODELENS=7, LINK=8 |
| `GuideType` | INDENT=0, BRACKET=1, FLOW=2, SEPARATOR=3 |
| `GuideDirection` | (platform-aligned with C++ core) |
| `GuideStyle` | SOLID=0, DASHED=1, DOUBLE=2 |
| `SeparatorStyle` | SINGLE=0, DOUBLE=1 |
| `KeyCode` | NONE=0, BACKSPACE=8, TAB=9, ENTER=13, ESCAPE=27, DELETE_KEY=46, LEFT=37, UP=38, RIGHT=39, DOWN=40, HOME=36, END=35, PAGE_UP=33, PAGE_DOWN=34, A=65, C=67, D=68, V=86, X=88, Y=89, Z=90, K=75, SPACE=32 |
| `KeyModifier` | NONE=0, SHIFT=1, CTRL=2, ALT=4, META=8 |
| `EditorCommand` | NONE=0, CURSOR_LEFT=1, CURSOR_RIGHT=2, CURSOR_UP=3, CURSOR_DOWN=4, CURSOR_LINE_START=5, CURSOR_LINE_END=6, CURSOR_PAGE_UP=7, CURSOR_PAGE_DOWN=8, SELECT_LEFT=9, SELECT_RIGHT=10, SELECT_UP=11, SELECT_DOWN=12, SELECT_LINE_START=13, SELECT_LINE_END=14, SELECT_PAGE_UP=15, SELECT_PAGE_DOWN=16, SELECT_ALL=17, BACKSPACE=18, DELETE_FORWARD=19, INSERT_TAB=20, INSERT_NEWLINE=21, INSERT_LINE_ABOVE=22, INSERT_LINE_BELOW=23, UNDO=24, REDO=25, MOVE_LINE_UP=26, MOVE_LINE_DOWN=27, COPY_LINE_UP=28, COPY_LINE_DOWN=29, DELETE_LINE=30, COPY=31, PASTE=32, CUT=33, TRIGGER_COMPLETION=34 |

---

## 13. Platform-Specific Allowances

### 13.1 Bridge Layer (MAY differ)

Each platform uses its own native bridge technology. This is expected and not constrained:

| Platform | Bridge Technology |
|---|---|
| Android | JNI (`jeditor.hpp`) |
| Swing | Java FFM (`EditorNative.java`) |
| WinForms | P/Invoke (`NativeMethods`) |
| Apple | Swift C bridge (`CBridge.swift`) |
| OHOS | NAPI (`napi_editor.hpp`) |
| Flutter | FFI (Dart) |

### 13.2 Input Method Handling (MAY differ)

IME integration is inherently platform-specific:

| Platform | IME API |
|---|---|
| Android | `InputConnection` |
| iOS | `UITextInput` |
| macOS | `NSTextInputClient` |
| Swing | `InputMethodRequests` |
| WinForms | `ImmAssociateContext` / TSF |
| OHOS | IME Kit |

### 13.3 Optional Modules

| Module | Mobile | Desktop |
|---|---|---|
| `copilot/` (InlineSuggestion) | SHOULD | SHOULD |
| `contextmenu/` (ContextMenu) | MAY | SHOULD |
| `selection/` (SelectionMenu) | SHOULD | MAY omit |
| `perf/` (PerfOverlay) | SHOULD | SHOULD |

### 13.4 Rendering Details (MAY differ)

Minor visual differences are acceptable:
- Line number background rendering mode
- Scrollbar visual style and animation
- Cursor blink timing
- Selection handle shape
- Platform-native font rendering differences

---

## 14. Threading and Concurrency Model (MUST)

State-mutating editor operations and host-visible callbacks are UI-thread-affine by default. Platforms MAY expose additional thread-safe query surfaces, but MUST choose a concrete threading model; platforms SHOULD explain that model through code comments, type annotations, or a README.

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| State-mutating API thread | **MUST** | Public methods that mutate editor state or trigger visible UI updates MUST be called on the UI thread unless the platform explicitly documents an equivalent serialized threading model |
| API thread contract documentation | **SHOULD** | Platforms SHOULD use code comments, type annotations, or a README to identify which public APIs are UI-thread-only and which pure query / snapshot APIs, if any, are safe to call from background threads |
| Pure query API thread | **SHOULD** | Pure query / snapshot APIs SHOULD either remain UI-thread-only or be explicitly documented as background-safe; platforms MAY allow background reads only when implemented safely |
| Event callback thread | **MUST** | All event callbacks / delegate invocations / stream emissions that are visible to host code MUST execute on the UI thread |
| Provider call thread | **MUST** | Platforms MUST choose a stable invocation model for `provideDecorations()` and `provideCompletions()` (UI thread, worker thread, or another serialized executor); platforms SHOULD explain that model to host code through code comments, type annotations, or a README |
| Provider async callback thread | **MUST** | Provider result delivery may happen from any thread, but the Manager MUST switch back to the UI thread when applying results to Core or mutating host-visible editor state |
| `buildRenderModel()` | **MUST** | `buildRenderModel()` MUST observe a stable editor snapshot. Platforms MAY require UI-thread calls or provide a stronger thread-safe snapshot contract, but the returned `EditorRenderModel` SHOULD be treated as immutable and MAY be safely read on the render thread |
| `NewLineActionProvider` | **MUST** | `provideNewLineAction()` MUST complete synchronously on the input path so Enter handling does not depend on a later async callback |
| Thread safety annotations | **SHOULD** | Platforms SHOULD annotate thread constraints in public API documentation (e.g. Java `@MainThread`, Swift `@MainActor`) |
## 15. Error Handling (MUST)

Public APIs use defensive handling for invalid inputs; managed-language host-facing public APIs MAY fail fast using language-idiomatic errors, but bridge / FFI boundaries MUST ensure invalid input cannot cause native / C++ crashes or undefined behavior; exceptions in Provider callbacks are isolated by the Manager.

### 15.1 Public API Parameter Validation

| Scenario | Constraint | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Line / column out of bounds | **MUST** | Automatically clamp to valid range `[0, max)`; MUST NOT throw exceptions |
| null / empty parameters | **MUST** | Platforms MUST honor the nullable semantics of parameters that are defined as nullable. For MUST-non-null parameters, managed-language public APIs SHOULD fail fast using platform-idiomatic errors (for example Java `NullPointerException` / `IllegalArgumentException`, C# `ArgumentNullException`) and MUST NOT cause native / C++ crashes or undefined behavior; bridge / FFI boundaries MUST handle invalid input safely |
| Invalid enum values | **MUST** | For host-facing public APIs that are forced to expose integer enum values, platforms MUST handle invalid values explicitly; managed-language public APIs SHOULD fail fast using platform-idiomatic errors (for example `IllegalArgumentException`), and MAY instead fall back to a default value. For raw integer enum values used by `EditorCore`, bridge layers, or FFI layers, platforms are not required to repeat host-level business validation, but MUST NOT allow invalid input to cause native / C++ crashes or undefined behavior |
| Calls outside ready / active lifecycle | **SHOULD** | Platforms SHOULD follow the lifecycle rules in Sections 3.0.3 and 16.3. Before a declarative editor instance is ready, or after terminal teardown, getters SHOULD return `null` or default values. Mutating imperative calls MUST be ignored or rejected and MUST NOT be queued. After terminal teardown, runtime-affecting calls MUST be no-ops or return default values. This rule primarily applies to declarative controllers, explicit teardown APIs, or platforms with a defined terminal session lifecycle boundary |

### 15.2 Provider Exception Handling

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Exception capture | **SHOULD** | Platforms SHOULD isolate Provider exceptions where practical so a single Provider does not affect other Providers or crash the editor; for Providers on the synchronous input hot path (such as `NewLineActionProvider`), platforms MAY skip a uniform try-catch wrapper and use a lighter or platform-native strategy instead |
| Exception logging | **MAY** | Platforms MAY log caught exceptions; the standard does not require any specific log format or fields such as Provider class name |
| Post-exception behavior | **SHOULD** | The failing Provider's result for this cycle SHOULD be discarded; subsequent refresh cycles SHOULD continue calling the Provider (no automatic disabling) |

### 15.3 C++ Core Error Propagation

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Bridge layer error conversion | **MUST** | Error codes returned by C++ Core MUST be converted to platform-idiomatic error representations in the bridge layer (e.g. Java logging + no-op, Swift `Result` type); MUST NOT propagate C++ exceptions directly to upper layers |
| Memory allocation failure | **MUST** | When C++ Core memory allocation fails, the bridge layer MUST handle it safely (e.g. return an empty model); MUST NOT cause undefined behavior |

---

## 16. Lifecycle Management (MUST)

Resource creation and destruction follow explicit ordering constraints to prevent dangling references and memory leaks.

For all platforms, the conformance target is terminal release-path safety plus eventual native-resource release. The standard does not require every platform to expose an explicit `dispose()` / `close()` / `release()` API, and it does not require a single cross-platform deterministic destruction moment. Platforms MAY satisfy the release-path requirement through an explicit teardown API, a host-managed lifecycle, widget or controller destruction, destructor / RAII / `Drop`, ARC / `deinit`, GC / finalizer-backed reclamation, or another platform-idiomatic cleanup mechanism. For GC-managed imperative widget platforms, the standard does not require inventing a synthetic terminal session-teardown hook solely for conformance; the primary requirement is eventual native-resource release plus safety after teardown or release.

### 16.1 `EditorCore` Lifecycle

| Phase | Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Creation | **MUST** | `EditorCore` instance MUST be created during widget initialization (imperative frameworks: constructor or init; declarative frameworks: on first widget mount) |
| Release path | **MUST** | The platform MUST ensure that `EditorCore` and its native / C++ resources are eventually released. An explicit `dispose()` / `close()` / `release()` API is optional. Platforms MAY instead rely on a host-managed editor lifecycle, widget/session destruction, destructor / RAII / `Drop`, ARC / `deinit`, GC / finalizer-backed automatic reclamation, an equivalent platform cleanup hook, or another platform-idiomatic strategy. For GC-managed imperative widget platforms, eventual reclamation through GC, finalizer, Cleaner, or an equivalent runtime-backed cleanup mechanism is sufficient even when the platform does not expose a distinct terminal session callback. Controller destruction only counts when it is part of the associated editor instance's terminal cleanup path. View detachment, widget unmount, or temporary removal from the view tree is NOT by itself required to be the final reclamation moment |
| Post-teardown calls | **MUST** | If the platform exposes an explicit terminal teardown API, or otherwise keeps the object reachable and callable after logical teardown or internal release, subsequent calls MUST NOT access invalid native / C++ resources and MUST NOT trigger further editor side effects or callbacks. Mutating calls MUST be no-ops or return default values. Getter calls MAY return `null`, default values, or last-known managed snapshots, as long as they do not require live native state or trigger lazy recomputation against released resources |
| Repeated release | **MUST** | If the platform exposes explicit release logic, multiple invocations MUST be idempotent (no-op); MUST NOT cause double-free |

> The standard requires eventual native-resource release, but does **not** require every platform, or every `Document` / bridge wrapper, to expose an additional explicit release API beyond its own lifecycle model. Platforms SHOULD prioritize logical teardown safety: stop timers, detach listeners, cancel or stale-mark async receivers, and break reference chains that would otherwise keep the editor object graph alive. If a platform exposes explicit teardown logic or another known terminal cleanup callback, it MUST perform the corresponding logical teardown cleanup. On GC-managed imperative widget platforms that do not expose such a terminal cleanup hook, proactive cleanup remains a SHOULD rather than a MUST. If a platform chooses to keep returning last-known managed snapshots after teardown, it SHOULD document that those values are stale snapshots rather than live editor state.

### 16.2 Provider Lifecycle

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Registration timing | **MUST** | Providers MUST be registerable at any time after the associated editor instance is ready. The standard MUST NOT require registration to occur after `loadDocument(...)` or after document availability |
| Pre-attachment calls | **MUST** | On declarative platforms, provider registration calls are only valid after the associated editor instance completes its initial attachment. Host code SHOULD register providers from `whenReady()` or an equivalent ready signal. Calls before that point MAY be ignored or rejected, but MUST NOT be queued by `SweetEditorController` and MUST NOT create a hidden runtime |
| Invocation prerequisites | **MUST** | Providers MAY be invoked only when the current session has the context/data required by that provider type. If prerequisite document/context data is unavailable, the platform MAY delay invocation, skip invocation, or follow the module-specific empty/default-context contract when such a contract exists |
| Registration ownership | **MUST** | Provider registrations exposed to host code MUST belong to the currently associated `SweetEditor` session/runtime. They are session-scoped registrations, not controller-owned state |
| Session cleanup | **MUST** | If the platform defines an explicit session teardown phase, internal detach hook, or another platform-native destruction callback that semantically represents terminal session cleanup, it MUST cancel or stale-mark all in-flight provider work associated with that session, stop related timers/listeners/receivers, ignore late results from the old session, and MUST clear or terminally deactivate session-owned provider registrations as part of that session teardown. If a GC-managed imperative platform does not expose such a terminal cleanup hook, proactive session cleanup is SHOULD rather than MUST; eventual reclamation by the managed runtime is acceptable, provided late results cannot access invalid native state after release |
| Controller forwarding boundary | **MUST** | `SweetEditorController` MAY forward provider registration calls to the bound `SweetEditor`, but the standard MUST NOT require the controller to retain provider registrations across editor lifetimes or after terminal session teardown |
| Cleanup during terminal teardown | **MUST** | If the platform defines an explicit controller `dispose()` / `close()` / `release()` phase, or another equivalent final logical teardown hook, it MUST clear controller-owned readiness callbacks and internal pending callbacks, and cancel or stale-mark any controller-owned async work so late results are ignored. It MUST NOT imply controller-side ownership of session provider registrations. On GC-managed platforms, when such an explicit or platform-native terminal cleanup hook exists, the equivalent logical teardown MUST still detach listeners, stop timers, and cancel or stale-mark async receivers so late results cannot keep the editor object graph alive or mutate freed native resources / host-visible editor state. If no such terminal cleanup hook exists on a GC-managed imperative platform, proactive cleanup remains SHOULD rather than MUST |
| Provider references | **SHOULD** | Platform implementations SHOULD avoid Providers holding strong references to the widget instance to prevent circular references causing memory leaks (Java/Kotlin: WeakReference; Swift: weak/unowned; Dart: no special handling needed) |

### 16.3 `SweetEditorController` Lifecycle (Declarative Frameworks)

`SweetEditorController` is associated with a single declarative editor instance. It is created by host code, passed to `SweetEditor` at construction time, and acts only as the host-facing forwarding entry for that editor instance. An explicit `close()` / `dispose()` / `release()` API is optional and, when present, represents terminal controller teardown rather than normal widget removal.

| Phase | Constraint | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Creation | **MUST** | Controller MUST be created by host code and provided to `SweetEditor` when that editor instance is constructed; lifecycle is managed by the host |
| Association | **MUST** | The association between a `SweetEditorController` and a `SweetEditor` instance MUST be established during construction of that editor instance and MUST remain fixed for that editor lifetime |
| Internal attachment | **MUST** | The widget/session MUST internally attach during initialization or mount, and internally detach during terminal cleanup of that editor instance |
| Post-teardown state | **MUST** | After the associated editor instance reaches terminal teardown, the Controller MUST become inactive. Subsequent runtime-affecting operations MUST be no-ops or return default values |
| Ownership boundary | **MUST** | The Controller MUST NOT own the bound widget/session runtime. `EditorCore`, render/runtime objects, overlay runtime, focus/gesture pipelines, and current binding timers/listeners belong to the currently bound widget/session |
| Explicit teardown (if provided) | **MAY** | Platforms MAY provide an explicit terminal controller teardown method such as `dispose()`, `close()`, or `release()`. This is optional for both GC-managed and non-GC platforms when terminal teardown is already guaranteed by the host lifecycle or by platform-native destruction semantics |
| Rebinding | **MUST NOT** | A `SweetEditorController` MUST NOT be rebound to another widget/session/editor instance after its initial association is established |
| Teardown ordering and boundary | **MUST** | If the platform provides an explicit controller teardown method, it MUST first detach from the associated widget/session if still attached, then release controller-owned internal state, clear readiness callbacks and internal pending callbacks, cancel timers/listeners/receivers/in-flight async work, and break reference chains. Any method call after teardown MUST be a no-op or return a default empty value. The Controller MUST NOT assume ownership of the bound widget and MUST NOT directly destroy the `View` / `Control` / `Widget` itself |
| Declarative rebuild | **SHOULD** | Ordinary declarative rebuilds that preserve the same mounted editor runtime SHOULD continue to use the same controller association and MUST NOT be treated as rebinding |

> This section applies only to platforms that expose an independent controller object. It MUST NOT be interpreted as requiring every imperative `View` / `Control` / `Widget` / `Document` type to add a library-defined `dispose()` / `close()` method. Internal detach means the controller is no longer connected to its associated editor session. Controller teardown means terminal deactivation of the controller itself; it does not transfer ownership of, or destroy, the bound widget.

### 16.4 Resource Release Order

When the platform performs editor release / dispose / close / final teardown, it MUST satisfy the following safety constraints. For GC-managed platforms, these constraints primarily apply to logical teardown and reference-chain cleanup; final native reclamation MAY happen later, as long as the torn-down object graph can no longer produce user-visible effects or touch invalid native state.

- All in-flight async Provider requests MUST be cancelled or marked stale before their results can reach invalid native state
- Provider registrations MUST be cleared or terminally deactivated before they can emit further callbacks into a destroyed editor
- Host-visible event subscriptions / listeners / observers MUST be cleared before post-destruction callbacks can occur
- `EditorCore` / native resources MUST be released exactly once and only after no further platform callbacks can legally use them
- Platform-specific resources (textures, canvases, timers, etc.) MAY be released in platform-idiomatic order, as long as the constraints above are preserved

> The standard defines dependency / safety ordering here, not a single mandatory cross-platform step sequence.

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pointerCursorType` | PointerCursorType | **MUST** on desktop, **MAY** on touch-only platforms | Pointer cursor hint for the current mouse location in the snapshot |

> Desktop platforms SHOULD map `pointerCursorType` to the native cursor shape, typically `TEXT` for text editing regions, `HAND` for clickable interactive content, and `DEFAULT` for neutral chrome such as scrollbars or gutter areas when appropriate.

> On platforms that surface both fields, `GestureResult.pointerCursorType` and `EditorRenderModel.pointerCursorType` SHOULD remain semantically consistent. Platforms MAY use the gesture result for immediate cursor updates and the render model as the latest stable snapshot state.

> Platforms MUST consume the Core-provided `active` state for clickable runs and apply the corresponding hover or pressed styling consistently for both `CODELENS` and `LINK`.

## 18. Document Specification (MUST)

`Document` is the core data type of the editor, wrapping the C++ side document handle.

### 18.1 Construction Methods

All platforms MUST support at least the following two construction methods:

| Method | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| From string | **MUST** | `Document(text: String)` - create from in-memory text content |
| From file path | **SHOULD** | `Document(file: File)` / `Document(path: String)` - create from a local file; large-file loading strategy is platform-specific |

> Constructor parameter naming and types MAY vary by platform (e.g. Java `File`, C# `string path`, Swift `URL`), but semantics MUST be consistent.

### 18.2 Public Methods

| Method | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `getLineCount()` | **MUST** | Returns the total number of lines in the document |
| `getLineText(line)` | **MUST** | Returns the text content of the specified line (excluding line ending) |
| `getText()` | **SHOULD** | Returns the complete document text |

### 18.3 Internal Implementation

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Native document reference | **MUST** | `Document` MUST internally retain a bridge-layer reference to a C++ side document instance; whether this is represented as an opaque handle, pointer wrapper, object wrapper, or another mechanism is an implementation detail |
| Resource release | **MUST** | When `Document` reaches its terminal platform lifecycle state, the bridge layer MUST eventually release the C++ side document memory. The exact cleanup mechanism is platform-specific, and an explicit `dispose()` / `close()` API is optional on both GC-managed and non-GC platforms |
| Encoding model | **MUST** | Platform layers MUST NOT assume or expose a specific internal storage / layout encoding beyond the semantics guaranteed by the public APIs |
| Line endings | **MUST** | C++ Core supports LF, CR, and CRLF line endings; text returned by `getLineText()` MUST NOT include line endings |

### 18.4 Relationship with `loadDocument()`

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Loading timing | **MUST** | After creation, `Document` MUST become the editor's current document either via `loadDocument(doc)` or, on declarative platforms, via declarative initialization inputs for the first attached editor session. If declarative initialization uses `text` instead of `document`, the platform MUST first materialize an equivalent `Document` from that text and treat the materialized `Document` as the current document. A `Document` that has not become the current document for any editor session will not trigger rendering or editor events |
| Document replacement | **MUST** | Calling `loadDocument()` again replaces the current document. On declarative platforms, changing the declarative current-document input for the same mounted editor runtime has the equivalent effect. If the declarative update uses `text`, the replacement document is the newly materialized `Document` created from that text. The old document reference is managed by host code |
| Document ownership | **SHOULD** | The same `Document` instance SHOULD NOT be loaded into multiple editor instances simultaneously |
## 19. `EditorMetadata` and `LanguageConfiguration` Field Definitions (MUST)

### 19.1 `EditorMetadata`

`EditorMetadata` is a **semantic concept type** representing host-defined metadata attached to an editor instance. The platform layer is responsible only for storing and returning it, not interpreting its internal structure.

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Representation form | **MUST** | Platforms MUST provide some representation capable of carrying arbitrary host-defined metadata; they MAY use a marker interface / protocol / abstract class / base class / `Object` / `any` / `unknown` / generic payload, etc. |
| Explicit type naming | **SHOULD** | If the platform chooses to expose an explicit public type, it SHOULD be named `EditorMetadata`; language-conventional variants such as `IEditorMetadata` or `SEEditorMetadata` are also allowed |
| Purpose | **MUST** | Host code stores and retrieves custom metadata (e.g. file path, language ID) via `setMetadata()` / `getMetadata()`; the platform layer MUST treat it as an opaque value and MUST NOT impose its own schema |
| Retrieval semantics | **MUST** | `getMetadata()` MUST return the same metadata value previously set, or `null` if none exists; if the platform exposes a wider carrier type (such as `Object?`), host code is responsible for its own casts / type assertions |

### 19.2 `LanguageConfiguration`

`LanguageConfiguration` describes metadata for a specific programming language.

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `languageId` | String | **MUST** | Language identifier (e.g. `"java"`, `"cpp"`, `"swift"`) |
| `brackets` | List\<BracketPair\>? | **MAY** | Bracket pair list (null = not configured; platform MUST NOT sync to Core when null) |
| `autoClosingPairs` | List\<BracketPair\>? | **MAY** | Auto-closing bracket pair list (null = not configured; platform MUST NOT sync to Core when null) |
| `tabSize` | int / int? | **MAY** | Tab stop width |
| `insertSpaces` | bool / bool? | **MAY** | Whether pressing Tab inserts spaces instead of a hard tab character |

**`BracketPair`** sub-type:

| Field | Type | MUST/MAY | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open` | String | **MUST** | Opening bracket (e.g. `"("`, `"{"`, `"["`) |
| `close` | String | **MUST** | Closing bracket (e.g. `")"`, `"}"`, `"]"`) |

| Rule | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Construction | **SHOULD** | SHOULD provide Builder pattern construction (Java/Kotlin); MAY use direct constructors or named-parameter constructors (Swift/C#/Dart/ArkTS) |
| Immutability | **SHOULD** | SHOULD be immutable after construction |
| Optionality and defaults | **MUST** | Platforms MAY expose `tabSize` / `insertSpaces` as nullable or non-null fields. If nullable, `null` MAY mean "use editor default". If non-null, their default values MUST match the editor defaults |
| Runtime effect | **MUST** | When `setLanguageConfiguration()` is called, bracket matching, auto-closing behavior, and Tab insertion behavior visible to the editor MUST be updated consistently with the new configuration |
| `tabSize` semantics | **MUST** | `tabSize` and `insertSpaces` MUST be treated as independent dimensions: `tabSize` controls tab-stop width, while `insertSpaces` controls whether the Tab key inserts spaces or a hard tab character |
| `insertSpaces=true` behavior | **MUST** | If `insertSpaces` is `true`, the Tab key / `INSERT_TAB` command MUST insert the number of spaces required to reach the next tab stop, rather than always inserting a fixed `tabSize` count |
## 20. Performance Guidance & Reference Targets (SHOULD)

Based on the `perf/` module (`PerfOverlay`, `PerfStepRecorder`, `MeasurePerfStats`) and the C++ Core `PERF_TIMER` macros, this section defines cross-platform performance guidance and reference targets rather than hard conformance gates.

### 20.1 Runtime Performance Invariants

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Viewport-scoped rendering | **MUST** | Layout and painting on the platform side MUST be scoped to the visible region (plus small lookahead buffers when needed); platforms MUST NOT require full-document relayout or redraw for ordinary scrolling |
| Provider non-blocking | **MUST** | Slow decoration / completion providers MUST NOT block typing, scrolling, or painting on the host-visible interaction path |
| Stale async results | **MUST** | Outdated async provider results MUST be cancellable or discarded before they mutate visible editor state |
| Core/layout duplication | **MUST** | Platform hot paths MUST NOT redundantly recompute geometry or layout information that is already produced by Core and can be consumed directly |
| Performance diagnostics | **SHOULD** | Platforms SHOULD preserve enough timing hooks to support PerfOverlay or equivalent debug-only performance diagnostics |

### 20.2 Reference Targets

The following numbers are reference targets for release builds on representative hardware. They are optimization goals, not conformance gates.

| Metric | Constraint Level | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scroll frame rate | **SHOULD** | >= 60fps on reference hardware | Scrolling SHOULD maintain near-60fps for documents under 10K lines |
| `buildRenderModel()` latency | **SHOULD** | <= 8ms | Exceeding 8ms is marked as SLOW (consistent with `WARN_BUILD_MS` across platforms) |
| Single-frame draw latency | **SHOULD** | <= 8ms | Exceeding 8ms is marked as SLOW (consistent with `WARN_PAINT_MS` across platforms) |
| Single-frame total latency | **SHOULD** | <= 16.6ms | Exceeding 16.6ms is marked as SLOW FRAME |
| Single render step | **SHOULD** | <= 2ms | Exceeding 2ms is marked with `!` in PerfOverlay (consistent with `WARN_PAINT_STEP_MS`) |
| Input path latency | **SHOULD** | <= 3ms | Time from gesture/keyboard event to Core processing completion (consistent with `WARN_INPUT_MS`) |

### 20.3 Large Document Performance Guidance

| Scenario | Constraint Level | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| 100K-line document loading | **SHOULD** | Use memory mapping, streaming load, or equivalent large-file strategies to avoid allocating all memory at once; load time target is <= 500ms on reference hardware |
| 100K-line document scrolling | **SHOULD** | Rely on viewport rendering (only layout and draw visible lines); scroll frame rate target is >= 30fps on reference hardware |
| Memory usage | **SHOULD** | Platform-layer memory usage target for a 100K-line document is <= 50MB (excluding C++ Core document storage) |

### 20.4 Provider Timeout Guidance

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DecorationProvider` timeout | **SHOULD** | If no decoration result is delivered within 5 seconds, the Manager SHOULD cancel or mark the request stale |
| `CompletionProvider` timeout | **SHOULD** | If no completion result is delivered within 3 seconds, the Manager SHOULD cancel or mark the request stale |
| `NewLineActionProvider` latency | **MUST/SHOULD** | `provideNewLineAction()` MUST stay synchronous on the input path and SHOULD complete within a sub-millisecond to 1ms budget on reference hardware; it MUST NOT introduce user-perceptible Enter-key latency |

### 20.5 `PerfOverlay` Debug Panel (SHOULD)

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| API | **SHOULD** | Each platform SHOULD provide `setPerfOverlayEnabled(bool)` / `isPerfOverlayEnabled()` APIs |
| Default state | **MUST** | PerfOverlay MUST be disabled by default; for debug use only |
| Display position | **SHOULD** | When enabled, SHOULD display a semi-transparent performance panel at the top-left of the editor area |
| Display content | **SHOULD** | SHOULD include at minimum: FPS, per-frame total/build/draw latency, text measurement statistics |
| Stability | **MUST** | PerfOverlay field names, thresholds, and step names are for debug display and MUST NOT be treated as a stable API contract |
## 21. Testing Standards (SHOULD)

### 21.1 C++ Core Tests

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Test framework | **MUST** | C++ Core uses the Catch2 framework (`tests/` directory) |
| Regression tests | **MUST** | Each core module (Document, Layout, Decoration, EditorCore) MUST have corresponding regression tests |
| Performance baselines | **SHOULD** | SHOULD use Catch2 `BENCHMARK` macros to establish performance baseline tests (e.g., `performance_baseline.cpp`) |
| Coverage scope | **SHOULD** | SHOULD cover: text editing operations, cursor/selection, undo/redo, IME composition input, decoration offset adjustment, layout mapping, scroll metrics |

### 21.2 Platform-Layer Tests

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | **SHOULD** | Each platform SHOULD provide unit tests for Core-layer data types (e.g., `EditorSettings` default value validation, `EditorTheme` factory method validation) |
| Integration tests | **MAY** | MAY provide widget-level integration tests (e.g., create widget → load document → verify line count) |
| Test framework | **SHOULD** | Use the platform's idiomatic test framework (Android: JUnit/Espresso, Apple: XCTest, C#: xUnit/NUnit, OHOS: Hypium) |

### 21.3 Cross-Platform Consistency Verification

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| API contract tests | **SHOULD** | Each platform SHOULD verify that Public API behavior is consistent with this standard document (e.g., `getWrapMode()` returns the same value after `setWrapMode()`) |
| Render model consistency | **MAY** | MAY compare `buildRenderModel()` output structure (line count, VisualRun count, etc.) across platforms for identical input |
| Event consistency | **SHOULD** | SHOULD verify that identical operations trigger the same event sequences across platforms |

## 22. Accessibility Standards (MAY)

Accessibility support is at the MAY level, but implementations SHOULD follow the guidance below.

### 22.1 Basic Accessibility Properties

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Role annotation | **SHOULD** | The editor widget SHOULD be annotated as a "text editor" role (Android: `AccessibilityNodeInfo.setClassName("android.widget.EditText")`, iOS: `accessibilityTraits = .updatesFrequently`, macOS: `NSAccessibilityRole.textArea`) |
| Text content | **SHOULD** | SHOULD expose currently visible text content to accessibility services |
| Cursor position | **SHOULD** | SHOULD expose current cursor position and selection range to accessibility services |
| Line information | **MAY** | MAY expose current line number and total line count to accessibility services |

### 22.2 Keyboard Navigation

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Focus management | **SHOULD** | The editor widget SHOULD be focusable and defocusable via the Tab key |
| Keyboard shortcuts | **SHOULD** | Desktop platforms SHOULD support standard keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+C/V/X/Z/A, etc.) |
| Screen reader compatibility | **MAY** | MAY support screen reader text narration (VoiceOver, TalkBack, Narrator) |

### 22.3 Visual Aids

| Rule | Constraint Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| High contrast | **MAY** | MAY provide a high-contrast theme or respond to system high-contrast settings |
| Font scaling | **SHOULD** | SHOULD respond to system font scaling settings (via `setScale()` or `setEditorTextSize()`) |
| Cursor visibility | **SHOULD** | The cursor SHOULD have sufficient visual contrast, and blink frequency SHOULD be between 0.5–2 Hz |

## 23. Versioning

This standard applies to SweetEditor platform implementations as of 2026-03. When the C++ core adds new enums, events, or API methods, all platforms MUST be updated to match within the same release cycle.

### 23.1 Platform Package Version Numbering

Platform package version numbers MUST maintain alignment with the C++ Core version. The version format is `a.b.c` (major.minor.patch).

| Segment | Constraint | Rule | Example (Core `1.0.0`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a` (major) | **MUST** | Platform package major version MUST match the Core major version and MUST NOT exceed it | Package `1.x.x` ✅; `2.0.0` ❌ |
| `b` (minor) | **SHOULD** | Platform package minor version SHOULD NOT exceed Core minor version `+9`; exceeding requires documented justification | Core `1.0.0` → package `1.9.x` is the recommended ceiling |
| `c` (patch) | **MAY** | Platform package patch version may increment freely for platform-specific bugfixes | `1.0.15` ✅ |

- When Core releases a new major version (e.g. `2.0.0`), all platform packages MUST upgrade their major version within the same release cycle.
- Platform packages MAY independently release patch versions (`c` increment) while the Core version remains unchanged, for platform-specific fixes.
- The recommended ceiling on the minor version (`b`) is to prevent platform package versions from diverging too far from the Core version, which would cause version mapping confusion.
